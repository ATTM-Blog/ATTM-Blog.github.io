As an Engineer learning and becoming mode embedded in the model based design world, I though it worthwhile to recording my thoughts on engineering subject, workflows and interesting tasks with other like minded folk. This blog may take on a broader view as I blog about small problems or projects I have at work or on the bench in the garage. \n\nMy personal interest cover a whole host of disciplines, from mechanical, electrical and electronic to the purer mathematics and physics that generally underpins our engineering effort. This quickly leans to an interesting in the history of engineering, why and how did we do things in time gone by? Would it be better now?\n\nI think its healthy to critically analyse how we engineer things. Change can be good, but we must not forget it can be quite the opposite, as engineers are we left to engineer? or are we becoming consumed by larger and wider company functions such as project management or even IT. \n\nI hope you enjoy this blog, its an experiment. Who know where it will end up?\n\nCheers, M",
